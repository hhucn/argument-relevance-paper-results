Whether money was obtained or not, same goes if you pawn or sell said items, as the government and record company did not recieve any of that money or recieve money for the receipt of said material. Thus, in legal terms, the only way to watch a movie or listen to music or read a book legally is to a) watch it in theaters, b) wait for it top show up on TV, c) listen to it on the radio, or d) borrow it from a government run or properly licensed private library.
